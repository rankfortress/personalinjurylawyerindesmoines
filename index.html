	Rouse Law P.C. is a small legal firm in Des Moines, IA, but it has a record of achieving big results. Mr. Rouse has been able to achieve millions in negotiated settlements and compensation awards. Too often, clients who retain the services of large firms wind up feeling anonymous—even inconsequential to the firm and its fleet of attorneys. No client wants to feel like a mere case number. Rouse Law, on the other hand, provides each client with the personalized attention they deserve. He takes time with his clients, allowing them to ask questions and get answers in layman’s terms so they perfectly understand each aspect of their case. He bases his legal counsel on the particulars of each client’s unique situation. If you’re looking for this type of custom care, bring your case to Rouse Law for a free initial consultation.
